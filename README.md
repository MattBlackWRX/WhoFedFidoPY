#### Description:
Who Fed Fido is a web app built with the flask framework using a Python back-end and Javascript front-end along with some Jinja code as well.

The owners will be sent an email via a GMAIL API alerting them that their pet has been fed a meal (breakfast, lunch, or dinner).

The main file app.py uses the Flask framework in building the app. If not already created the app.py file will create all the needed sqlite tables. This file provides each possible path in the webpage and what to execute when the user accesses the page. Each page outside of register.html will require a user to log in. The register.html file is the webpage users will access to register for Who Fed Fido. The app requires a unique username and email. If an already registered username or email is entered the back-end will redirect the user to apology.html which will explain the username or email has already been taken. Users are also required to select a timezone. Once the information is entered,
